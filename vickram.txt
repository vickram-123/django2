In the air, carbon dioxide is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, acting as a greenhouse gas.
 It is a trace gas in Earth's atmosphere at 417 ppm (about 0.04%) by volume, having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm.
 [9][10] Burning fossil fuels is the primary cause of these increased CO2 concentrations and also the primary cause of 
 global warming and climate change.[11] Carbon dioxide is soluble in water and is found in groundwater, lakes, ice caps, 
 and seawater. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water it forms carbonic acid (H2CO3), which causes ocean acidification as 
 atmospheric CO2 levels increase
