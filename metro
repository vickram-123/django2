The turkey is a large bird in the genus Meleagris, native to North America.
 There are two extant turkey species: the wild turkey (M. gallopavo) of eastern and central North America
  and the ocellated turkey (M. ocellata) of the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. This photograph, taken at Deer
   Island Preserve in Novato, California, shows a male Rio Grande wild turkey (M. g. intermedia)
   strutting – the courtship display, in which the snood (the erectile, fleshy protuberance on the forehead)
   engorges with blood, becomes redder and elongates, hanging well below the beak.
